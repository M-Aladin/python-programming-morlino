# average_function.py
# For this exercise the pseudo-code is required (in this same file)
# Write a function that calculates the average of the values of
# any vector of 10 numbers
# Each single value of the vector should be read from the keyboard
# and added to a list.
# Print the input vector and its average
# Define separate functions for the input and for calculating the average

"""
pseudo-code:

INPUT FUNCTION:
- initialize list
- input number from keyboard
- append to list
- repeat previous two steps for a total of 10 times

AVERAGE FUNCTION:
- sum all the numbers in the list
- divide by list length (in this case, we already know it's 10)

- call input function
- call average function passing the vector as an argument
- print the input and the average
